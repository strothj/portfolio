During my courses at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/), I was given the goal
of putting together a rest api with an example user interface.

Pomoapp is a time management tool that leverages the
[Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). It helps
users devote time to small chunks of their project goals while also forcing them
to take regular breaks.

## Objective

My goal was to not only implement the REST api in Node.js, but to implement it
using TypeScript. Another goal was to forgo the simpler placeholder jQuery interface
and instead implement it using Google's Material Design and Vue.js.
